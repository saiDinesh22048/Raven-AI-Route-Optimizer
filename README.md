# Raven Route Optimizer - Smarter Logistics Routing

## 🚀 Overview

Raven Route Optimizer is a web-based application designed to **optimize routes for logistics providers**, ensuring efficient and safe deliveries. By leveraging **real-time data** and advanced algorithms, Raven Route Optimizer helps delivery drivers and fleet managers by:

- **Real-time route adjustments** based on traffic, weather, air quality, and elevation.
- **Multi-factor route analysis** for safer and more efficient paths.
- **Dynamic rerouting** to adapt to changing conditions.
- **Interactive route visualization** with detailed metrics.

## 🔥 The Problem & Our Idea

### Problems We Address:
- **Unpredictable Delays**: Traffic jams, sudden weather changes, and poor air quality cause delays, disrupting delivery schedules and increasing fuel costs.
- **Static Route Planning**: Lack of real-time route adjustments leads to missed deadlines and inefficient fleet management in dynamic conditions.
- **Driver Safety and Efficiency**: Harsh weather, poor air quality, and steep elevations pose risks to drivers and vehicles, complicating logistics operations.

### Our Solution:
✅ **Real-Time Route Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts routes using live data on traffic, weather, air quality, and elevation to minimize delays and fuel costs.  
✅ **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Balances traffic, weather, air quality, and elevation using a heuristic-based A* algorithm to ensure the safest and most efficient routes.  
✅ **Dynamic Rerouting**: Continuously recalculates routes to adapt to changing conditions, ensuring timely deliveries and optimal fleet management.  
✅ **User-Friendly Visualization**: Provides an interactive map interface with route details (distance, duration, AQI, weather, elevation gain) and alternative routes for informed decision-making.

## 💡 Challenges We Faced

### Real-Time Data Integration
- **Fetching live data** from multiple APIs (Google Maps, WeatherAPI, Google Air Quality, Google Elevation) without exceeding rate limits.
- **Synchronizing data updates** to ensure route calculations reflect the latest conditions.
- **Handling edge cases**, such as areas with poor data coverage or API failures.

### Route Optimization
- **Balancing multiple factors** (traffic, weather, AQI, elevation) in the A* algorithm’s cost function to avoid over-penalizing any single constraint.
- **Ensuring computational efficiency** in the A* algorithm (`apply_a_star`) for real-time performance.
- **Managing dynamic rerouting** to avoid excessive recalculations while maintaining route optimality.

### Frontend Visualization
- **Rendering routes smoothly** on a Leaflet map with real-time updates and alternative route options.
- **Displaying detailed metrics** (distance, duration, AQI, weather, elevation gain) in a clear and user-friendly route info panel.
- **Ensuring responsiveness** of the map interface across different devices.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Route Optimization System

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Fetch real-time data** on traffic, weather, air quality, and elevation using APIs.
2. **Calculate route heuristics** by balancing multiple factors (traffic, weather, AQI, elevation) in the A* algorithm.
3. **Optimize routes dynamically** using the `dynamic_route_optimization` method to adjust paths in real time.
4. **Visualize routes** on an interactive map with detailed metrics and alternative routes.

#### Major Challenges:
- **Real-time data consistency** across multiple APIs with varying update frequencies.
- **Efficient A* implementation** to handle large graphs without performance bottlenecks.
- **Dynamic rerouting logic** to detect and respond to significant changes in constraints (e.g., traffic delays, weather changes).
